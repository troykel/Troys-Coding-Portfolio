# hello-world
My 1st year of Programming.  I'm learning Python with the help of https://www.sololearn.com/ and https://www.udemy.com/. In the past I've worked in multilingual Tech Support (Spanish and German), but I've always wanted to learn Programming, but never had the guts to try it. So here it goes! Wish me luck!
